### Introduction to the "Talk to Santa" Application

The "Talk to Santa" application is a magical experience designed to bring joy to children during the holiday season. This landing page allows parents to register their children to receive a personalized call from Santa Claus. Using a Python script that integrates the OpenAI API (GPT-4), Santa Claus will interact with children, talking about the gifts they received and other personalized details. The call will be made through the Twilio API. The purpose is to offer a unique and magical experience while raising funds to donate to an NGO that provides toys to children during Christmas.
